Welcome to QuickNotes, a note-taking application. Here are the basics.

## QuickNotes is fast

QuickNotes is desgined to be the fastest way to create and find notes.

To To help in that we support many keyboard shortcuts:
* **n** : create a new note
* **Ctrl-Enter** : save a note (when in editor)
* **Esc** or **/** : search notes

## Features

We support plain text and Markdown-formatted notes.

Notes are private by default.

You can make them public if you want to share your knowledge and ideas with other. See [an example](https://quicknotes.io/u/w9Yw/kjk) of public notes.

You can organize notes with tags, to make them easier to find later.

Or you can use our lightning-fast search (`/`).

You can star most frequently used notes for fastest access.
